1. I want to able to ask questions to Santa or one of his Elves
	
2. See how naughty or nice I've been (maybe based on questionair? but feel free to be creative!)
	
3. My gift was broken, I want to provide feedback 
	
4. I don't want write my list. I want to be able to take pictures in the store and share those or share my drawing of the gift
	
5. I want to have suggestions on music/recepies 
	
6. I want to know where Santa is (and know when I can expect my package)
	
8. I want voice support (i.e. make a wishlist or check where Santa is)
